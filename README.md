## General Information
- I took on this project as a means of reinforcing my understanding of JavaScript Classes.


## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js


## Setup
> You need to have *Git* and *Node.js* installed. If you don't have them installed, you can:
> - follow these [instructions to set up Git on Windows or MacOS](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/f1-u3-git-setup) or these [instructions to set up Git on Linux](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#linux)
> - follow these [instructions to install Node.js on Windows or MacOS](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally) or these [instructions to install Node.js on Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04)

1. Navigate to the directory you would like the project to reside. Use the command line interface to clone the project:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/peterkibuchi/find-your-hat
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd find-your-hat
   ```

3. Execute the following command to play the game:
   ```
   node main.js
   ```

Voila! You're all set up. Guidance on how to play will be provided within the game. Enjoy.

Feel free to tinker with the code as well, see if you can make it better. Don't [shy away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sO-Y1Zbft4) from contibuting back to the project if you do.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_.


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Refactor the code to make it more concise and succinct.
- Improve the gameâ€™s graphics and interactivity in the terminal.

To do:
- Create a field validator to ensure that the randomly generated field can actually be solved.


## Acknowledgements
- I learnt how to deal with user input in the terminal from [this tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/getting-user-input-in-node-js).
